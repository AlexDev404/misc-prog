Miscellaneous Programs and websites I have been working on in the past couple of years and use for creating websites and other projects.

I am sharing this to the community in case somebody wants to use the source for one of their websites or projects.
This is the source I personally use myself regularly when creating websites for people or organizations.

This bundle of code includes websites from:

- TrailBlaze Labs
- Atomic Inc.
- EliteFN / MythFN

This bundle also includes some (actually many) test sites I created while experimenting with different tactics and methods when creating a website.

Most of this code in this repository here is mostly reused and built upon from older websites I have created.
All the code in here is mine (for the exception of Project #1, Project #2, Snek Online and VentureCo (template)) which were tutorials I followed when I was first starting out (credit to [DevEd](https://youtube.com/DevEd), you're amazing bro!) and rarely includes hooks to external libraries and frameworks. The only hooks I have used are for fonts and sometimes images.

Currently, I am creating an appstore, so I will be pushing regular updates for all to see here.

This repository will remain active, and will stay active, until I either abandon my work on websites, or stop for whatever reason.

Regular pushes will be done to this repository.

You may reuse whatever code is in here but you must make sure to follow the `LICENSE`. 
Even if a file is not marked with the `LICENSE` it is still under it.

Happy Coding! :D
